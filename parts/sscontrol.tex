\subsection{Pole Placement}

\subsubsection{Gain Matrix}

Consider the state space model
\begin{align*}
	\dot{\vec{x}}(t) & = \mx{A} \vec{x}(t) + \mx{B} \vec{u}(t), \\
	\vec{y}(t)       & = \mx{C} \vec{x}(t) + \mx{D} \vec{u}(t),
\end{align*}
and assume that we can somehow always know the state \(\vec{x}\). Then we add a feedback loop from the state to the input with the \emph{gain matrix} \(\mx{K}\) (see figure \ref{fig:ss-pole-placement}). This introduces a new term for the desired value \(\vec{r}\) and changes the state space equation to
\[
	\dot{\vec{x}} = \left(\mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K}\right) \vec{x} + \mx{B}\vec{r}.
\]
The addition of \(\mx{K}\) allow to change the eigenvalues of the system matrix and thus move the poles. Therefore, the poles of the new matrix \(\tilde{\mx{A}} := \mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K}\) are called the regulator poles. To allow an arbitrary placement of poles the system needs to be completely controllable. Without any additional construction, the gain matrix is basically a proportional controller (German: \textsl{P-Regler}).

% When using the pole placement for stability it is important to keep in mind the following points:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item All poles must be on the LHP,
% 	\item All transients should decay fast,
% 	\item The system should be sufficiently damped, for example by setting \(\zeta > 1/\sqrt{2}\),
% 	\item \texttt{TODO}.
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solve for the Gain Matrix}

Now, if we wish to bring the poles of the closed loop system to the locations \(\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_n\), in the most general case we can use the fact that
\begin{align*}
	\det\left(s\mx{I} - \tilde{\mx{A}}\right)
		&= \det\left(s\mx{I} - \mx{A} + \mx{B}\mx{K}\right) \\
		&= (s - \mu_1)(s - \mu_2) \cdots (s - \mu_n) \\
		&= s^n + \alpha_1 s_{n-1} + \dots + \alpha_{n-1} s + \alpha_n,
\end{align*}
and solve for the entries of \(\mx{K}\) by comparing coefficients.

If the state space representation is in the diagonal form (decoupled, eigenmodes), then finding \(\vec{K}\) is as simple as solving for the entries of \(\mx{K}\):
\[
	\mx{A} - \mx{B} \mx{K} =
	\underbrace{
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\mu_1 \\
			& \ddots \\
			& & \mu_n
		\end{bmatrix}
	}_{\mx{M}}.
\]
Sometimes it is possible to do \(\mx{K} = \mx{B}^{-1} (\mx{A} - \mx{K})\), but more often the system is overdetermined and we are free to choose some entries of \(\mx{K}\) (which is even easier).

If the state space representation is in the controllable canonical form, and 
\[
	\mx{K} = \begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 & \ldots & k_n \end{bmatrix}
\] \\
since \(\tilde{\mx{A}} = \mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K} = \)
{\small
	\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
			\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 \\
			-a_n -k_1 & -a_{n-1} - k_2 & -a_{n-2} - k_3& \dots & -a_1 - k_n
		\end{bmatrix},
	\]
}
which means that
\[
	G(s) = \frac{
		b_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \dots + b_1 s + b_0
	}{
		s^n + (a_{n-1} + k_n) s^{n-1} + \dots + (a_0 + k_1)
	},
\]
the poles are found by comparing the coefficients of the denominator:
\begin{align*}
	s^n + (a_{n-1} + k_n) &s^{n-1} + \dots + (a_0 + k_1) \\
		&= (s - \mu_1)(s - \mu_2) \cdots (s - \mu_n).
\end{align*}

\subsection{Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)}

A problem of the pole placement approach is that it is not always obvious which poles should be moved and where. The \emph{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) also called \emph{quadratic optimal regulator} solves this problem.

In the LQR design we define a performance index to minimize:
\[
	J = \int_0^\infty \left(
		\vec{x}^* \mx{Q} \vec{x} + \vec{u}^* \mx{R} \vec{u}
	\right) \, dt,
\]
where \(\mx{Q}\) and \(\mx{R}\) are positive definite (or semidefinite) Hermitian or real symmetric matrices. The \(\mx{Q}\) matrix determines the importance of the relative error, whereas the \(\mx{R}\) matrix determines the cost (in energy) of modifying the state.  Since in the pole placement \(\vec{u} = -\mx{K}\vec{x}\) the problem becomes
\[
	\argmin_{\mx{K}}
	\int_0^\infty \vec{x}^* \left(
		\mx{Q} + \mx{K}^* \mx{R} \mx{K}
	\right) \vec{x} \, dt.
\]
Then, the expression can be further developed by using the fact that
\[
	\vec{x}(t) = e^{(\mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K}) t} \vec{x}(0),
\]
which when substituted into the previous expression gives
\[
	\vec{x}(0)^* \underbrace{\int_0^\infty \left[
			e^{(\mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K}) t}
		\right]^* \left(
			\mx{Q} + \mx{K}^* \mx{R} \mx{K}
		\right) e^{(\mx{A} - \mx{B}\mx{K}) t}
		\, dt}_{\mx{S}(\mx{K})}
	\, \vec{x}(0).
\]
The minimization problem is completed by computing
\[
	\text{minimize } J \iff
	0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial K_{ij}} =
	\vec{x}^*(0) \frac{\partial \mx{S}}{\partial K_{ij}} \vec{x}(0).
\]
It is possible to show that the resulting optimal gain matrix is
\[
	\mx{K} = \mx{R}^{-1} \mx{B}^* \mx{S}.
\]
The LQR optimization problem can also be described in terms of the output
\[
	J = \int_0^\infty \left(
		\vec{y}^* \mx{V} \vec{y} + \vec{u}^* \mx{R} \vec{u}
	\right) \, dt,
\]
and in a state space model \(\mx{A}, \mx{B}, \mx{C}\) with \(\mx{D} = \vec{0}\) can be rewritten using \(\vec{x}\) as follows:
\(
	\vec{y}^* \mx{V} \vec{y} =
	\vec{x}^* \mx{C}^* \mx{V} \mx{C} \vec{x}.
